## High-Yield Topics

Based on exam frequency, prioritize:

**Paper A**:
- Antipsychotic mechanisms and side effects
- Antidepressant pharmacology
- Lithium (monitoring, toxicity, interactions)
- Neurotransmitter systems
- Learning theories

**Paper B**:
- Depression and bipolar management
- Schizophrenia treatment algorithms

- Critical appraisal of trials
- Mental Health Act sections

## Common Exam Pitfalls

Questions often test:
- Similar-sounding drugs/conditions differentiation
- First-line vs. second-line treatments
- Contraindications and cautions
- Specific numerical values (drug levels, time courses)
- Evidence base for interventions
